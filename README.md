>*#NAME*

**How to install Xampp and connect it to localhost to access remotely database.**

>*#DESCRIPTION*

**XAMPP** is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.

**PhpMyAdmin** is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on MySQL and MariaDB. Frequently used operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.

\
    Step 2:  Install Xampp.

        Make sure to check the Apache and MySQL on installation. Apache acts as your local Web server, when you start Apache on XAMPP, you basically start a web hosting service locally on your computer. Even though you've enabled MySQL on XAMPP, you wouldn't be able to access your phpmyadmin portal without turning Apache on.
